# Tanks

### The Game
Tanks is a mini online battle with your friend of choice. The objective is to kill your enemy by hitting them 10 times with your bullets. Keep an eye on power-ups that spawn within the arena, as they are the key to victory. For a quick look on how the game looks, check out the screenshots folder!

### How it Works
Information on where your opponent is in relative to the screen is sent over a network using UDP packets. Positions of the enemy are
sent every frame for real time play.
The game runs at a smooth 60 FPS, and is powered by the processing environment.

### Download
Downloads are soon to come for Mac, Windows, and linux. (Game is close to being finished)
